# G'day! ðŸ‘‹
![Visitor Count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=AmAComputerNerd&color=blue)

I'm **Jonathon**, better known online as **ThatComputerNerd** (or some variation if the username is taken - GitHub and Reddit being main examples of this ðŸ™ƒ). I am a passionate, primarily self-taught programmer with a love for tech. I began learning programming with projects in languages like Java and Python - the projects publicly available on here are just a few select examples of what I've done over the years.

Currently, I'm working as an Associate Software Engineer at WiseTech Global under their innovative Earn & Learn program. I'm proud to be one of 52 students within the second ever cohort which started January 2024! Now half way through their Rotations program, which has me developing in 3 different teams over 1 and a half years before selecting a regular team to develop under, I've learned much about C#, Vue, MS SQL and Enterprise Software development so far and am eager to continue learning even more in the years ahead.

### A little about me! :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: I'm a 19-year-old male, born and living in what the Americans might call the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="11">
- :classical_building: I'm currently juggling an accelerated, part-time Bachelor of Computing Science (IDeA) degree at UTS with full-time work at WiseTech Global. One year down, three to go!
- :computer: Personal projects are on hold for now, thanks to the demands of work and uni. But I **do** have a backlog of ideas, so new content might be coming soon! Most of it will probably be in C# since it's kind of become my main language now, but I've also got a couple of ideas for web projects which could be interesting ðŸ¤”
- :mailbox: Want to connect? I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below).

## Programming Languages :man_technologist:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cpp,cs,css,dotnet,git,html,java,kotlin,py,sqlite&perline=7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdfyQJ40nQ)
#### I have worked with all of these languages in various capacities, whether as a personal project, educational project or as an enterprise-level project. Of these languages, I am most comfortable with Java, Python and C#, which I have several years of previous experience with and still actively use even now. The other languages above are tools in my kit so to say, but not a primary focus at this stage.

#### I use a load of different tools and IDEs in developing my projects. My main IDE of choice for is typically the JetBrains-equivalent product, but Microsoft's Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are also frequently used.

## Development Practices :hammer_and_wrench:
#### I'm well-versed in several enterprise development practices like TDD, SOLID Principles and CI/CD, which are essential for keeping large projects organised, clean and efficient.
