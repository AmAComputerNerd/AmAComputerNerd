# G'day! üëã
![Visitor Count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=AmAComputerNerd&color=blue)

I'm **Jonathon**, better known online as **ThatComputerNerd** (or some variation if the username is taken - GitHub and Instagram being main examples of this üôÉ). I am a passionate, primarily self-taught programmer with a love for tech. I began learning programming with projects in languages like Java and Python before progressing into C# through my work - the projects publicly available on here are just a few select examples of what I've done over the years.

Currently, I'm working as an Associate Software Engineer at WiseTech Global under their innovative Earn & Learn program. I'm proud to be one of 52 students within the second ever cohort which started January 2024! I'm now a permanent developer under the International Logistics: Carbon Emissions team, working with other talented developers in creating brand new features for our flagship product under the CargoWise Next upgrade. I've learned a lot throughout the course of the Rotations program, which had me rotating through 3 teams over 1 and a bit years to refine my skills and knowledge in different areas of programming. My last rotation especially had a big impact on me as I played a full-time 11-week role in training and tutoring the 2025 cohort of Earn & Learn to get students ready to begin their careers as knowledgable and effective associate software engineers within WiseTech!

### A little about me! :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: I'm a 19-year-old single male, born and living in what the Americans might call the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="11">
- :classical_building: I'm currently juggling an accelerated, part-time Bachelor of Computing Science (IDeA) degree at UTS with full-time work at WiseTech Global, where I am achieving High Distinction grades for all classes thus far. One year down, three to go - hoping my efforts continue to pay off!
- :computer: Personal projects are on hold for now, thanks to the demands of work and uni. But I **do** have a backlog of ideas, so new content might be coming soon! Most of it will probably be in C# since it's kind of become my main language now, but I've also got a couple of ideas for web projects which could be interesting ü§î. All that being said, my friends and I are thinking of developing a train app soon for Android - certainly has the potential to be an interesting project when it goes public üòÅ!
- :mailbox: Want to connect? I'm almost always available on Discord and LinkedIn, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below).

## Programming Languages :man_technologist:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cpp,cs,css,dotnet,git,html,java,kotlin,py,sqlite&perline=7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdfyQJ40nQ)
#### I have worked with all of these languages in various capacities, whether as a personal project, educational project or as an enterprise-level project. Of these languages, I am most comfortable with Java, Python and C#, which I have several years of previous experience with and still actively use even now. The other languages above are tools in my kit so to say, but not a primary focus at this stage.

#### I use a load of different tools and IDEs in developing my projects. My main IDE of choice for is typically the JetBrains-equivalent product, but Microsoft's Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are also frequently used.

## Development Practices :hammer_and_wrench:
#### I'm well-versed in several enterprise development practices like TDD, SOLID Principles and CI/CD, which are essential for keeping large projects organised, clean and efficient.
