# G'day! üëã
![Visitor Count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ThatComputerNerd&color=blue)

I'm **Jonathon**, better known online as **ThatComputerNerd** (or some variation if the username is taken - GitHub, I'm looking at you üòÜ). I am a passionate, primarily self-taught programmer with a love for all things tech. My journey in programming began with languages like Java and Python, where I've learned through countless projects. Currently, I'm working as an Associate Software Engineer at WiseTech Global under their innovative Earn & Learn program. I'm proud to be one of 52 students within the second ever cohort which started January 2024 and looking forward to getting to meet with and guide the next year's cohort! I've learned much about C#, SQL and Enterprise Software development in my time at WiseTech so far, and am eager to continue learning even more in the years ahead.

### A little about me! :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: I'm an 18-year-old male, born and living in what the Americans might call the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="11">
- :speech_balloon: I'm currently juggling an accelerated, part-time Bachelor of Computing Science (IDeA) degree at UTS with full-time work at WiseTech Global. With a solid three years still ahead, I'm excited about the challenges and learning opportunities that will lie ahead!
- :computer: Personal projects are on hold for now, thanks to the demands of work and uni. But I **do** have a backlog of ideas, so new content might be coming soon!
- :mailbox: Want to connect? I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below). I'm planning on releasing a website soon which will serve as a main hub of formal conversation, though Discord will still remain as the go-to place to hit me up for a casual convo. I look forward to hearing from you!

## Programming Languages :man_technologist:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cs,css,git,html,java,kotlin,py,sqlite&perline=5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdfyQJ40nQ)
#### I have worked with all of these languages in various capacities, whether as a personal project, educational project or as an enterprise-level project. Of these languages, I am most comfortable with Java, Python and C#, which I have a wealth of previous experience with and still actively use to this day. The other languages are tools in my kit but not a primary focus at this stage.

#### I use a load of different tools and IDEs in developing my projects. My main IDE of choice for is typically the JetBrains-equivalent product, but Microsoft's Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are also frequently used

## Development Practices :hammer_and_wrench:
#### I'm well-versed in several enterprise development practices like TDD, SOLID Principles and CI/CD, which are essential for keeping large projects organised, clean and efficient.
