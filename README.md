# G'day all üëã
I'm **Jonathon**, also known online as **ThatComputerNerd** (or similar variations, if my username isn't available). I'm a self-taught and motivated programmer, now working 4-5 days a week at WiseTech Global as part of their Earn & Learn program! While I won't have the same time as I used to have (with university and work sapping most of the week away), nevertheless, I may occasionally manage to pull through with a complete project, most of which I'll end up posting here :expressionless:.

> **Quick Note:** When it comes to the projects I have worked on, I seldom post them to GitHub until they have reached version 1.0 (in that they are functioning and completing their main purpose in a sense). I'm trying to change this habit moving forward, but it's important to note that I'm a **lot** more active than GitHub's charts suggest!

### A little 'bout me :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: male, also living in the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="20">
- :speech_balloon: I'm a first year university student at University of Technology Sydney, currently studying an accelerated Bachelor of Computing Science degree with my industry sponsor, WiseTech Global! I work for 4-5 days a week and attend uni in my spare time - may need to put some of these old projects on the backlog at this rate...
- :computer: Currently returning to the classic projects to spice them up a bit, hence doing work in pretty much every language I've worked in previously (Python, Java, C#, etc.). Also started doing some cyber security stuff through [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) (Gotta spice up my schedule somehow **¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø**). Will soon begin working on company projects too, though can't tell you much about those :3
- :mailbox: I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below). I'm planning on releasing a website soon which will serve as a main hub of formal conversation, though Discord will still remain as the go-to place to hit me up for a casual convo.

## Programming Languages :man_technologist:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cs,css,git,html,java,kotlin,py,sqlite&perline=5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdfyQJ40nQ)
#### I have previous experience in all of these languages (particularly Python and Java). Recent projects have me working in all of these languages actively right now and this is especially the case for C# (and XAML) with the revitalisation of my development work on [VOWs](https://www.github.com/AmAComputerNerd/VOWs) as a personal project.

#### I primarily utilise VS (and VS Code), alongside my main Java IDE of IntelliJ IDEA. Any other IDEs I use are for more specialised scenarios (i.e., Android Studio specifically for Android development).

### Social Media :calling:
- :speaker: **Discord:** username is *thatcomputernerd*. An enticing message is a good way to start the conversation! (plus, helps me weed out the bots from the humans üòÅ)
- :page_facing_up: **Website:** Coming soon! (...you know when your parents say 'soon', but they really mean 'when we feel like it'? Seriously though, hopefully will get this done soon - work and development on other projects has me swamped right now üòî)
- :video_game: **Steam**: [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatpcnerd)
- :shit: **Reddit**: [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/TechnoBob9)
