# Sup all ðŸ‘‹
I'm a standalone programmer aspiring to escape the mind-blocks I seem to encounter at every turn. Nevertheless, I sometimes manage to pull through with a project, most of which I end up posting here :expressionless:

> **HOT TIP:** Don't look at my past python files... for your own personal safety.

### A little 'bout me :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: [he/him], also a true blue Aussie :)
- :speech_balloon: Just a year 12 student trying to build up a bit of a portfolio. Going for a job in the IT industry atm, but may take a sec with uni right around the corner...
- :computer: Doing a lot of Java (Game Mods) and some Python (Scripts, Tools) but planning on expanding into C# or C++ as my main language.
- :mailbox: I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below).

#### I have the most experience in Java and Python, but am currently aiming on heavily expanding into C# and C++ development. I might even upload some of these apps when they get good enough.

#### I primarily utilise VS (and VS Code), alongside my main Java IDE of IntelliJ IDEA. Any other IDEs I use are for more specialised scenarios.
