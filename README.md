# G'day all üëã
I'm **Jonathon**, also known online as **ThatComputerNerd** (or similar variations, if my username isn't available). I'm a self- taught and motivated programmer aspiring to escape the mind- and very-literal-time- blocks (with work, activities, etc.) I seem to encounter at every turn. Nevertheless, I sometimes manage to pull through with a complete project, most of which I end up posting here :expressionless:.

> **Quick Note:** When it comes to the projects I have worked on, I seldom post them to GitHub until they have reached version 1.0 (in that they are functioning and completing their main purpose in a sense). I'm trying to change this habit moving forward, but it's important to note that I'm a **lot** more active than GitHub's charts suggest!

### A little 'bout me :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: male, also living in the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="20">
- :speech_balloon: I'm a year 12 student that just finished suffering through the HSC here in NSW, Australia. Uni is the next hit destination where I'll probably be doing a Bachelor of Information Technology with either a Cyber Security or Computer Science major, depending on which university / city I decide to study at.
- :computer: Currently returning to the classic projects to spice them up a bit, hence doing work in pretty much every language I've worked in previously (Python, Java, C#, etc.). Also started doing some cyber security stuff through [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) (Gotta spice up my schedule somehow **¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø**).
- :mailbox: I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below). I'm planning on releasing a website soon which will serve as a main hub of formal conversation, though Discord will still remain as the go-to place to hit me up for a casual convo.

## Programming Languages :man_technologist:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs,css,git,html,java,kotlin,py,sqlite&perline=5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZdfyQJ40nQ)
##### I have previous experience in all of these languages (particularly Python and Java). Recent projects have me working in all of these languages actively right now and this is especially the case for C# (and XAML) with the revitalisation of my development work on [VOWs](https://www.github.com/AmAComputerNerd/VOWs) as a personal project.

## IDEs & Related Skills :desktop_computer:

##### I primarily utilise VS (and VS Code), alongside my main Java IDE of IntelliJ IDEA. Any other IDEs I use are for more specialised scenarios (i.e., Android Studio specifically for Android development).

### Social Media :calling:
- :speaker: **Discord:** username is *thatcomputernerd*. An enticing message is a good way to start the conversation! (plus, helps me weed out the bots from the humans üòÅ)
- :page_facing_up: **Website:** Coming soon! (...you know when your parents say 'soon', but they really mean 'when we feel like it'? Seriously though, hopefully will get this done soon - work and development on other projects has me swamped right now üòî)
- :video_game: **Steam**: [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatpcnerd)
- :shit: **Reddit**: [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/TechnoBob9)
