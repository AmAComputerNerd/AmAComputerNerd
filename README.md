# G'day all üëã
I'm ThatComputerNerd / Jonno, a self-taught and motivated programmer aspiring to escape the mind-blocks I seem to encounter at every turn. Nevertheless, I sometimes manage to pull through with a project, most of which I end up posting here :expressionless:

> **Quick Note:** When it comes to the projects I have worked on, I seldom post them to GitHub until they have reached version 1.0 (in that they are functioning and completing their main purpose in a sense). I'm trying to change this habit moving forward, but it's important to note that I'm a **lot** more active than GitHub's charts suggest!

### A little 'bout me :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: male, also living in the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="20">
- :speech_balloon: I'm a year 12 student that just finished suffering through the HSC here in NSW, Australia. Uni is the next hit destination where I'll probably be doing a Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in Cyber Security or Computer Science with Cyber Security minors (depending on whether I end up going to QUT or UTS).
- :computer: Looking into more cyber security related work nowadays, but still actively using C# and XAML to build the app I submitted for my Major Design Project. See [VOWs](https://github.com/AmAComputerNerd/VOWs) to check on my work.
- :mailbox: I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below). I'm planning on releasing a website soon which will serve as a main hub of formal conversation, though Discord will still remain as the go-to place to hit me up for a casual convo.

**I have previous experience in all of these languages (particularly Python and Java) but am only actively working in C# and XAML (no icon for that one üòû) at the moment.**

## IDEs & Related Skills :desktop_computer:

**I primarily utilise VS (and VS Code), alongside my main Java IDE of IntelliJ IDEA. Any other IDEs I use are for more specialised scenarios (i.e., Android Studio specifically for Android development).**

### Social Media :calling:
- :speaker: **Discord:** username is *thatcomputernerd*. An enticing message is a good way to start the conversation! (plus, helps me weed out the bots from the humans üòÅ)
- :page_facing_up: **Website:** Coming soon! (you know when your parents say 'soon'.. but they really mean 'when we feel like it')
- :video_game: **Steam**: [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatpcnerd)
- :shit: **Reddit**: [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/TechnoBob9)
