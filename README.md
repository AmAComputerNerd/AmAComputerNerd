# G'day all 👋
I'm ThatComputerNerd / Jonno, a self-taught, standalone programmer aspiring to escape the mind-blocks I seem to encounter at every turn. Nevertheless, I sometimes manage to pull through with a project, most of which I end up posting here :expressionless:

> **HOT TIP:** My Python scripts aren't that good, so I'd avoid them if I were you. Nevertheless, they remain public in case you want to see them for some reason.

### A little 'bout me :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: male, also living in the "upside down" <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xv6hObo_xcI/YDBXp3WOKZI/AAAAAAAA3u8/9Yl2zkkcPPYxoPNRSzXm-46GAu-b_SYqwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Flag_of_Australia.gif" height="20">
- :speech_balloon: I'm a year 12 student suffering through the HSC here in NSW, Australia. Uni is the next hit destination where I'll probably be doing a Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in Cyber Security or Computer Science with Cyber Security minors (depending on whether I end up going to QUT or UTS).
- :computer: Looking into more cyber security related work nowadays, but still actively using C# and XAML to build the app I intend to submit for my Major Design Project. See [VOWs](https://github.com/AmAComputerNerd/VOWs) to check on my work.
- :mailbox: I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below). I'm planning on releasing a website soon which will serve as a main hub of formal conversation, though Discord will still remain as the go-to place to hit me up for a casual convo.

#### I have previous experience in all of these languages (particularly Python and Java) but am only actively working in C# and XAML (no icon 😞) at the moment.

#### I primarily utilise VS (and VS Code), alongside my main Java IDE of IntelliJ IDEA. Any other IDEs I use are for more specialised scenarios (i.e., Android Studio specifically for Android development).
