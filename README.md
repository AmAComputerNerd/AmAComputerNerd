## Sup all ðŸ‘‹
I'm a standalone programmer aspiring to escape the mind-blocks I seem to encounter at every turn. Nevertheless, I sometimes manage to pull through with a project, most of which I end up posting here :expressionless:

> **HOT TIP:** Don't look at my past python files... for your own personal safety.

### A little 'bout me :point_left:
- :bust_in_silhouette: [he/him], true blue Aussie :)
- :speech_balloon: Just a college student trying to build up a bit of a portfolio. Probably going into IT after graduating?
- :computer: Currently focusing on Python (Discord) and Java / Kotlin (Game Mod / Android)
- :mailbox: I'm almost always available on Discord, though I also have other social medias I sometimes use (see below).
